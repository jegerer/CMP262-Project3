## Web Scraped Data Analysis
This project asked students to use BeautifulSoup to scrape data from a website of their choosing and then use the Python libraries pandas and seaborn to conduct an analysis on the acquired data. Data used here was taken from the site *IndexMundi* and included monthly average energy commodity prices from March 2013 through March 2023.  Questions posed of the data included the following:
- Over the ten year period from March 2013 through March 2023 (121 months), how have the prices of crude oil (in dollars per barrel) from the different oil regions--Brent, Dubai, and West Texas Intermediate--compared with each other?
- Are crude oil prices affected by seasonality? Are these seasonal trends consistent from year to year?
- Do diesel and gasoline prices follow the same trend? Are there points over the last 10 years where there is a significant difference?
- Since crude oil is a major input in the production of gasoline, it would be expected that pricing for the two would trend similarly. Are there points in time where this trend deviates?
